                            <h5>April 2023-Ongoing</h5>
                            <p>In the bustling halls of Northpine Technical High School, I, Bantu, was just an ordinary teenager trying to navigate the labyrinth of teenage life. Like many others, I had my fair share of interests and hobbies, but little did I know that a serendipitous encounter would lead me to discover my true passion for software development.

                                It all began on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon. I had just finished my chemistry class and was making my way to the library to meet up with my friends. As I approached the library entrance, I noticed a vibrant poster announcing an upcoming coding workshop. Intrigued, I decided to check it out.
                                
                                Entering the library, I was greeted by a group of students huddled around a table, their eyes glued to computer screens, their fingers dancing across the keyboards. Curiosity piqued, I approached a friendly-looking student named Lisa, who was one of the workshop participants.
                                
                                "Hey, what's going on here?" I asked, my voice laced with curiosity.
                                
                                Lisa looked up, a smile lighting up her face. "Oh, hi! We're attending a coding workshop organized by the computer science club. We're learning how to build websites and develop software."
                                
                                My interest soared as I listened to Lisa explain the fascinating world of programming. She mentioned how coding empowered individuals to create websites, apps, and programs, turning ideas into reality through lines of code. Intrigued by the endless possibilities, I decided to join the workshop.
                                
                                Over the next few weeks, I delved headfirst into the world of software development. The workshop introduced me to various programming languages, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and Python. I found myself captivated by the logic and problem-solving aspects of coding. Every line of code I wrote felt like a puzzle piece, fitting together to create something meaningful.</p>

                            <p>I have always found electricity intriguing and very confusing in High School I chose Electrical Engineering and I do not regret the decision I made after leaving High School with my N4 in Electrical Engineering I was given a opportunity by a company called Oyinqobo Techno Solutions to come work for them as a Junior Electrical Technician and I really enjoyed my time there.</p>
